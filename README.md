#This is my documentation



##I tried to make a VCV rack module, it did not work... At all.
###### I tried using a lot of different methods. I tried following the website instructions. both using the Rack Software development kit, which helped me make my own plugin but it wouldn't open and I certainly couldn't make any modules. 
###### I then tried to use it by building the rack myself but it also did not work.
###### And then finally I got chat GPT to help me and it also didn't work.
###### So then I reverted to doing a website and I thought that it would be a good idea to make a prank  website advertising this module that I wasn't even able to begin making as the best thing ever.

##I made a website. 
###### I chat gpt helped me out a lot, there were a lot of things I didn't know to do but I learned asking chat GPT questions. 
###### There are a lot of things that still don't work. the front page the text moves but I wasn't able to fix it. also the music doesn't stop playing when another audio begins 
###### all around though I have learned a lot of how to use HTML, CSS and Javascript.
